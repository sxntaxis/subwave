// Session DJ agent — the conversational brain that runs over a stream session.
// Owns the pick and request runs; the pieces they're built from live in
// ./dj-agent/ (runs, schemas, breaker, agents, enqueue) and are re-exported
// below, so `from './dj-agent.js'` still reaches the whole surface.
//
// The system posts events into the session ("a track started, pick the next
// one"; "a listener requested X"); this hands the session chat window to a
// tool-loop agent that explores the library and decides. Its output is enqueued
// and appended back as turns, so the next event sees what the DJ just did.
//
// Gated on `settings.llm.pickerAgent`. Off, or on any agent failure, this falls
// back to the stateless pool picker + link generator so a pick is never missed.
// Either way the session is updated.

// Persona handoff — a two-voice mic-pass at a show boundary.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// When session.maybeRoll() hard-rolls and the effective PERSONA changed, it
// stamps roll metadata on the fresh session (session.pendingHandoff). This runs
// after the roll — driven by whichever maybeRoll call site fires first (the
// queue's track-start, or the :00 hourly cron) — and, when a handoff is pending,
// airs a sign-off in the OUTGOING persona's voice followed by a greeting in the
// incoming persona's voice. Both go through the serialized say.txt voice chain
// (queue.announce → airVoice), so they play cleanly back to back.
//
// Never throws (callers still need to run the pick after it) and is idempotent:
// it marks the handoff aired up front, so a concurrent second call — or a
// mid-way failure — can't double-air or retry into the middle of the new show.
// The two model calls are injectable for the same reason artist-guard's are:
// the thing worth pinning here is the WIRING — which memory each side of the
// mic-pass is handed — and that is only observable at the generator boundary.
// Production passes nothing and gets the real ones.
