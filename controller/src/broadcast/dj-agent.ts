// Session DJ agent — the conversational brain that runs over a stream session.
//
// This module owns the pick and request runs; the pieces they're built from
// live in ./dj-agent/ and are re-exported below, so `from './dj-agent.js'`
// still reaches the whole surface:
//
//   runs.ts      DJ-mode mini-runs (a short arc of picks heading somewhere)
//   schemas.ts   the pick/request output schemas and system prompts
//   breaker.ts   the circuit breaker that drops to the pool picker
//   agents.ts    the two tool-loop agent definitions
//   enqueue.ts   turning a chosen song into a queued track
//
// The system posts events into the session ("a track started, pick the next
// one"; "a listener requested X"); this module hands the session chat window
// to a tool-loop agent that explores the library and decides. Its output (the
// chosen track, an optional spoken link/intro) is enqueued and appended back
// to the session as turns, so the next event sees what the DJ just did.
//
// The conversational path is gated on `settings.llm.pickerAgent`. When it is
// off — or when the agent fails for any reason — this falls back to the
// stateless pool picker (music/picker.js) and the stateless link generator
// (llm/dj.js), so a pick is never missed. Either way the session is updated.
