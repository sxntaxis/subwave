// Back-to-back artist guard policy — pure, unit-pinned (#1124 / #1187 / #1251).
//
// The guard itself lives in dj-agent.pickViaAgent: when the agent's pick repeats
// the artist already on air, it re-picks from the run's OWN candidates. This
// module owns the one question that re-pick has to answer — WHICH candidates it
// may choose from — so the answer is testable without a model call, and so the
// policy isn't spread across the call site.
//
// #1251: excluding only the on-air artist gave the re-pick no memory of the
// slots before it. On any catalogue with a deep bench for the show's filters,
// whichever artist ranks next-highest wins the re-pick, and wins it AGAIN the
// next time the guard fires — no adjacent repeats, but the same artist every
// other slot (observed live: Marvin Gaye in 3 of 5 slots, all three placed by
// the guard). So the re-pick also steps around the artists of the last few
// plays, and only falls back to the bare on-air exclusion when that leaves it
// nothing — the same never-starve philosophy as #1187's pool rescue.
//
// #1406: that recency window only narrowed the re-pick POOL — the guard itself
// still fired on the on-air artist alone, so a pick three slots after the same
// artist was never examined and the window never consulted. The entry condition
// is the window too now (artistGuardCause below), which is what turns "no
// adjacent repeats" into actual spacing across a show.

import { artistRootKey, type CandidateLike } from '../../music/recency.js';

// that uses it, rather than reaching past it into music/recency.
export { artistRootKey };

// Default for `settings.llm.artistVarietyWindow` — how many recent plays the
// guard remembers. 5 covers the reported oscillation (an artist re-entering
// every other slot is inside any window ≥ 2; 5 also catches the slower
// every-third-slot shape) while staying far below the point where a
// show-filtered run's candidate set is likely to be wholly recent — and if it
// ever is, the fallbacks below hand the bare exclusion back rather than starving.
//
// NOTE the effective exclusion is wider than "5 plays": neighbourArtistRoots(n)
// gathers up to n queued-and-unaired tracks AND the on-air track AND the last n
// distinct plays — so this window can exclude up to 2n+1 artists, by design
// (the queued side is what covers pair-aware drains, where the pick is not
// adjacent to the track on air).

// artist all morning). They are NOT the same event and the caller escalates them
// differently, which is the whole reason this returns a cause rather than a
// boolean: back-to-back is worth a pool rescue and a relaxation log; spacing is
// a preference that yields to whatever the run already surfaced.
