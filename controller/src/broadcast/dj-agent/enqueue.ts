// re-check, no double log. A pre-applied KEEP does get re-scanned there
// (enqueuePick's second trimLinkToIntro pass can trim the kept text further),
// but that scan can't flip a no-hit into a hit: trimLinkToIntro only ever
// shortens text down to a leading prefix, and both echoesRequest measures
// (longest common run, LCS ratio) are non-increasing as the script shrinks to
// a prefix of itself — a second scan over less text finds no more than the

// AND the durable picks-log record so neither reports a phantom pick that never
// aired (push() has already logged the dedup-skip). Callers fall back on -1
// (agent → pool → auto.m3u) instead of recording a session turn for a no-op.

// `linkClockAt` is the air moment the link was written to speak, present only
// when a clock was offered at all — the queue drops the line if the real seam
// lands too far from it (#1314). Separate from the effects bag on purpose: it
// is about the LINK, not the transition.
