//   kinds.ts     the voice-kind registry the DJ recap reads
//   voice-io.ts  handoff-file writes + the spoken-segment serialiser

  // SHOW HANDOVER ORDERING (#1576)
  // The rule itself lives in broadcast/handover-policy.ts; these two methods are
  // the state it reads. They live on the queue because the queue is the only
  // thing that sees BOTH halves of the question — what aired (onSpoken, the one
  // post-air bookkeeping site) and how many tracks have started since.
  // ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  // Post-air hook: a programme outro just reached the stream, so a show is
  // signing off and the incoming host owes the listener a closing track first.
  //
  // Keyed on the kind rather than on the scheduler having FIRED the beat,
  // because the two are not the same thing: an operator pressing the outro pad
  // on the DJ page is signing the show off just as much as the beat is, and a
  // beat that was fired but never aired (voice off, TTS failure) has not.
  // Manual triggers are exempt from every automatic GATE, but this is not a
  // gate — it is a record of what the listener heard.
  //
  // Re-stamping is deliberate: a second sign-off restarts the wait rather than
  // inheriting a satisfied one.
  //
  // The incoming host's own first words settle the debt, so the two kinds that
  // can carry them clear the stamp. Not required for correctness — the rule
  // reads false once both counters are met — but a wait that is over should not
  // linger as live state on /debug, and a cleared stamp is one fewer thing for
  // onSessionRolled() to have to age out.

  // sweep later logs an unattributed "dropped N stale queue item(s)". The

  // request. That is the whole bug being fixed: the operator learns why.

  // Gated on `requestedBy` — the same discriminator as the cap and the boundary
  // cut exemptions above — because a request is the one path deliberately
  // exempt from every length rule the controller owns (maxTrackSeconds,
  // picker.minTrackLengthSeconds), and therefore the only path where a
  // sub-crossfade track is expected to arrive at all. push() is the chokepoint
  // every producer funnels through, so the listener route's three resolutions,
  // the DJ agent's request path, MCP and the studio queue are all covered by
  // this one call — there is no branch in routes/request.ts.
  //
  // The span is the PLAYABLE one, resolved by music/silence-trim.ts: a trimmed
  // head or tail is exactly what the buffer eats, and subtracting cue points
  // here instead is the drift that module exists to prevent.
  //
  // One honest limit, which the LINE ITSELF carries rather than only this
  // comment — the line is what the operator reads. `crossfadeDuration` is the
  // CONFIGURED figure; radio.liq reads liquidsoap_crossfade.txt once at mixer
  // startup, so between a crossfade change and a /restart-mixer the mixer is
  // still buffering the old value while this warning is measured against the
  // new one. Nothing in the controller can read the live figure, and warning
  // against the setting the operator can actually act on is the useful half.
  //
  // THE WHOLE BODY IS INSIDE A try/catch, and that is the load-bearing line
  // here rather than defensiveness. `playableSpanSec` resolves through
  // `library.get` → `db.getTrack`, which makes this the FIRST sqlite read on
  // the request critical path — everything push() touched before it (the
  // blocklist hit, the dedup scan) is in-memory. `library.get` guards
  // `!loaded` but not a DB error, so an unreadable library.db would throw out
  // of push(), out of the route, and turn a listener request into a 500. A
  // purely informational log line may not decide whether a request is queued.
