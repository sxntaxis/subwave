// waits for the next track boundary (#1485). `djTalkOnlyBetweenTracks` is the
// switch, read once per minute by the talk tick and resolved into TalkPlan.air
// by the pure planner. withTalkAir() is a SCOPE rather than a threaded flag, so
// anything spoken inside a scheduled fire defers, and manual triggers — which
// call the same runners from outside any scope — stay 'immediate'.
