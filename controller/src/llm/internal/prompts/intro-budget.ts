// Hard backstop for talk-within-the-intro (Stage A.3 phase 2): the budget PHRASE
// above is advisory — a small model will still occasionally overrun. This
// enforces it deterministically. Base speaking pace is ~2.5 words/sec, scaled
// by `paceScale` — the live speech-rate multiplier from
// audio/tts.speechPaceScale() (engine × persona × daypart) — so a persona
// speaking at 0.8× gets a proportionally smaller word ceiling; 1 (the
// default) is the historical fixed-pace assumption.
//
// A spoken fragment sounds like a station failure, so this NEVER hard-cuts
// mid-thought (#962): over-long lines trim to the last complete sentence that
// fits, else the last clause boundary (closed with a period so it still
// sounds intentional), else the line is DROPPED — callers treat '' as "no
// spoken intro" and the track just plays. Returns the text unchanged when
// there's no usable runway (null, very short, or a long ≥18s intro) —
// symmetric with introBudgetPhrase's guards.
//
// `firstVocalMs` (feature: vocal-aware transitions, additive 4th arg): the
// MEASURED first vocal entry when the track has one. The <2500ms leniency
// below exists because the energy-heuristic intro_ms is noise down there —
// but a measured vocal start under 2.5s means the singer genuinely starts
// immediately, and airing an un-budgeted line over them is the exact failure
// this module exists to prevent. So: measured < 2500 → DROP the line ('').
// When measured and ≥2500 it IS the runway (that's the definition of
// "before the vocals"); un-measured (null/undefined — includes analysed
// instrumentals) keeps today's behaviour byte-for-byte.
