// Structured output via a forced tool call. The result schema is presented as

// — the model's only legal move is to call `emit` once. Returns the validated
// object plus a token-usage block so callers can log it alongside the other

// is where the model weighs it. It lives HERE, not in any caller's prompt, for
// the reason every other cross-cutting decision in this codebase lives in one
// module: the caller cannot know which branch djObject will take
// (needsToolCallObject resolves that per LEG, at call time), so a caller that
// writes its own output-channel instruction is guessing — and half the time it
// guesses against the transport actually chosen.
//
// Issue #1536 is that failure with a measurement attached: the tagger's prompt
// said "Return ONLY a JSON object" while this path sent toolChoice:'required',
// and gemma-4-12b on llama.cpp spent its whole generation budget arguing with
// itself over which of the two to obey ("Wait! I just noticed... 'Return ONLY'.
// ... Tool calls are often used for *actions*. I'll go with direct output.")
// before being cancelled. The `emit` tool's DESCRIPTION already said calling it
// is how you answer; a tool description does not carry the weight a system
// instruction does against a system instruction pulling the other way.
//
// Kept to one line, no double quotes: it is prepended to every forced-object
// call on every leg, including the picker's terminal collapse.
