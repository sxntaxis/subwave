// djObject — schema-validated structured output. `schema` is a Zod object
// schema; the returned value is parsed and validated.
//
// Two attempts, because small/cloud models occasionally botch structured output
// (the AI SDK throws NoObjectGeneratedError — "could not parse the response"):
//   1. native    — Output.object, which forwards the schema to the provider's
//                   structured-output mode (constrained decoding where it's
//                   supported). Ollama instead takes the forced-tool path
//                   (objectViaToolCall) — it ignores JSON mode.
//   2. recovery  — plain free-text, then strip <think> blocks / ``` fences and
//                   Zod-validate ourselves. Catches models that wrap the JSON
//                   in reasoning the native parser chokes on.
// Throws only if BOTH attempts fail.
//
// EACH branch states its own output rule, and no caller states one. A system
// prompt is written once and then runs down whichever branch the LEG resolves
// to (needsToolCallObject, per call), so an output-channel instruction written
// at the call site is right on one branch and wrong on another — issue #1536,
// where the tagger's "Return ONLY a JSON object" met the forced-tool branch and
// a 12B local model deadlocked choosing between them. Keep the rules here:
// EMIT_ANSWER_INSTRUCTION (tool), NATIVE_JSON_INSTRUCTION (native), and the
// recovery prompt's own line below.

// Until this PR the tagger's own "output ONLY a JSON object" was what carried

// pushed every such call into the recovery attempt — a second billable call per
// batch, against settings.llm.dailyTokenCap, on a bulk job that runs per track.

// Anthropic — the exact conflict this change exists to remove. One line, no
// double quotes, same as EMIT_ANSWER_INSTRUCTION.
