// Station services — the curated facade a skill's data tool (a built-in or an
// operator's custom tool.mjs) gets to look at the world before the DJ speaks.
// This is the SINGLE place segment tools reach into the controller's internals
// (web search, the music library, the queue, feeds, durable recall). It is
// passed as the third argument to every tool fetcher:
//
//   export default async (ctx, state, services) => data
//
// so the contract stays backward-compatible — existing two-arg custom skills
// ignore the third arg and keep working.
//
// The surface is deliberately READ-MOSTLY: search, library reads, play-log
// reads, a durable dedup store, and a log line. No writes to settings, no
// secrets, no queue mutation — a custom tool.mjs running here is the operator's
// own code (same trust model as a local Claude Code skill), fenced by the 8s
// timeout at the call site, but it still shouldn't be handed the whole booth.
