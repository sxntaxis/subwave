// The `POST /settings` patch registry (#1348).
//
// `settings.update()` takes a PARTIAL patch over 49 top-level keys and validates
// it in a long chain of `if ('<key>' in patch)` branches — a route that owns
// forty-nine shapes doesn't fit #1337's one-schema-per-form recipe.
//
// This module is the frame the conversion lands in, one key at a time:
//
//   SETTINGS_PATCH_KEYS     every top-level key update() will act on
//   SETTINGS_PATCH_SCHEMAS  the subset converted to a shared schema so far
//   parseSettingsPatchKey() the strict posture — used INSIDE update()
//   validateSettingsPatch() the route posture — supplies `fieldErrors`
//
// Both postures run the SAME schema; only the consequence differs, which is
// #1337's rule. An unconverted key keeps its hand-rolled branch untouched and
// simply has no entry here, so the frame can land without a flag day.
//
// WHY UNKNOWN-KEY REJECTION IS A ROUTE POSTURE AND NEVER AN update() RULE
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------
// At the route, rejecting an unknown top-level key is right: every admin panel
// posts keys from this inventory, so an unknown one is a typo that would
// otherwise save nothing and still answer 200.
//
// Inside update() the same rule would be a data-loss bug. routes/backup.ts hands
// a whole backup settings.json to update(), as do onboarding and every internal
// caller. A backup written by a newer version carries keys this one has never
// heard of, and refusing the patch would turn "one setting didn't come across"
// into "the restore failed". So the inventory is enforced at the boundary the
// operator types at, and update() stays tolerant of keys it doesn't know.
