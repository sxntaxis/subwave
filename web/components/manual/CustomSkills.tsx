        <h2>One thing: a between-track line.</h2>
        <p>
          A SUB/WAVE skill is a single between-track <em>spoken segment</em>: the DJ
          glances at something, then either says one short line over the music or stays
          quiet. The format borrows from{' '}

          (a <code className="bs-code-inline">SKILL.md</code> with YAML frontmatter and a
          markdown body, plus optional code), but the meaning is narrower. These don&rsquo;t
          process documents or run tasks; they decide what the DJ says next.

        <p className="bs-eyebrow">EDITING THE BUILT-INS</p>
        <h2>The shipped skills are files too.</h2>
        <p>
          The seven built-ins (weather, news, now-playing digs, curiosity, album anniversaries,
          library deep-cuts, and web search) ship as read-only templates under{' '}
          <code className="bs-code-inline">controller/src/skills/builtins/&lt;kind&gt;/</code>, and
          the first time the station boots both their{' '}
          <code className="bs-code-inline">SKILL.md</code> <em>and</em> their{' '}
          <code className="bs-code-inline">tool.mjs</code> are seeded into{' '}
          <code className="bs-code-inline">state/skills/&lt;kind&gt;/</code>.
          From then on they&rsquo;re ordinary editable skills: change the brief, cooldown,
          context, or label on the admin <strong>Skills</strong> page, and edit the{' '}
          <code className="bs-code-inline">tool.mjs</code> on disk + Rescan, exactly as you
          would for a skill you wrote. The seeder never overwrites a file that already exists,
          so your edits survive restarts and upgrades.
        </p>
        <p>
          A built-in still differs from a skill you add in three ways: it&rsquo;s enabled by
          default, it can be disabled but not deleted (delete its folder and the seeder
          restores it on the next boot), and its edit sheet has a{' '}
          <strong>↺ Reset to default</strong> that overwrites both files from the shipped
          template: the way back from a broken edit, and the way to pull in a newer
          image&rsquo;s <code className="bs-code-inline">tool.mjs</code>.

        <p>
          The big one: <strong>News reads the BBC by default</strong>. Hit{' '}
          <strong>Edit</strong> on the News skill, paste your own feed URL and rewrite the
          brief in your station&rsquo;s voice, then Save. It&rsquo;s live on the next break,
          no restart. News is an ordinary feed skill — the same{' '}

          ignores the frequency gate and the cooldown the way <strong>Run now</strong> does,
          but it is not an operator pressing a button, so it still stands down when the
          skill is off, when the on-air DJ doesn&rsquo;t run it, when the station voice is
          off, mid-programme, with nobody listening, or once the daily token budget is
          spent. Each stand-down says which of those it was in the booth log.

          Worth knowing before you add one: a cron <em>always speaks</em>. The ordinary
          between-track tick lets the DJ decide there&rsquo;s nothing worth saying, and it
          often does. A cron takes the forced path instead, where staying silent isn&rsquo;t
          on offer. Good for a fixed daily moment; poor for a skill written to speak only
          when something is notable.
